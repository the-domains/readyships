Ready Ships provides education, training, and certification in disaster and emergency management through short term "study at sea" programs.  

You will experience our "all hands on deck" approach to integrating your classroom and online learning into skills-based exercises on board our ships.  You will test your limits and grow an unparalleled understanding of your own capacities, capabilities and talents with a wide variety of disaster and emergency scenarios. 

And "this is no drill" - meaning our ships will be operating in disaster zones and will be deploying our students and instructors as "relief teams" to support ongoing efforts of governments, NGOs and the private sector. 

Whether you are a DEM student (graduate or undergraduate), an emergency management professional, or a volunteer seeking a study abroad program that makes a real difference, Ready Ships has a program for you.
